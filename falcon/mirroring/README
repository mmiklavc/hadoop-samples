This example assumes a single Sandbox cluster replicated to itself for demo purposes. This also uses the root account.

Either change paths and permissions accordingly, or you need to add root to the "users" group.

$ usermod -a -G users root

Create dirs and upload files
$ ./setup.sh

Upload cluster definitions
$ falcon entity -type cluster -file primaryCluster.xml -submit
$ falcon entity -type cluster -file backupCluster.xml -submit

Use the Falcon UI to create a mirroring job. Source and target should be configured as is shown in "setup.sh"
